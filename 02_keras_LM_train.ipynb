    "due to this, our training and decode networks are slightly different. our training network takes full sequence inputs, and outputs full sequence outputs (the inputs, offset by one). this is because we already know the full sequences we are training on: the actual cards. on decode, we want new cards, so we will generate each character at a time, and feed *that* predicted character (sampled randomly from the softmax distribution, for randomness) back into the LSTM to generate the next character. because the LSTM relies on a 'memory' of what it has already generated, we must also input the previous *states*, which we can do with `return_sequences=True`.\n",
